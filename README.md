# Rock Paper Scissors 

> Rock paper scissors (also known by several other names and word orders) is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).\

This simulation game is the same as the classic game with the difference that points have been added to it and your opponent is the computer.
